# Temperature-Sensor-Arduino-Uno
IoT (Internet of Things) has significant implications and potential in the healthcare industry. 
It offers innovative solutions to enhance patient care, improve operational efficiency, and 
enable better decision-making for healthcare professionals.

# Tools Used
1. Arduino Uno: It is a microcontroller board. It has 14 digital input/output pins,6 analog 
inputs, a 16 MHz ceramic resonator, a USB connection, a power jack, an ICSP header and a 
reset button. It contains everything needed to support the microcontroller.</br></br>
2. Breadboard: A breadboard, also known as a prototyping board or solderless 
breadboard, is a commonly used tool in electronics and prototyping. It provides a convenient 
way to build and test electronic circuits without the need for soldering.</br></br>
3. DS18B20 Temperature Sensor: This is a waterproof sensor used for measuring the 
body temperature of a person. It is a long wire with a metal cap at front which is held the the 
person whoâ€™s temperature is to be measured.</br></br>
4. 4.7 k-ohm Resistor: The 4.7 kilo-ohm resistor is often used in conjunction with the 
DS18B20 sensor for a process called "parasitic power mode". In parasitic power mode, the 
DS18B20 sensor derives power from the data line instead of requiring a separate power 
supply connection. The 4.7 kilo-ohm resistor plays a crucial role in this configuration by 
providing the necessary pull-up resistor for the data line.</br></br>
5. Connecting Wires: These are normal wires used for connecting circuits into a device 
or breadboard.
# Result
The result will be the temperature sensed by DS18B20 Temperature Sensor and will be displayed on the Serial monitor.
